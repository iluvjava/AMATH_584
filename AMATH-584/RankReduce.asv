function [U_tilde, S_tilde, V_tilde] = RankReduce(U, S, V, r)
%  The function does a rank reduction on the SVD matrices of a given
%  matrix. 
%  U, S, V:
%     These are the matrix gotten from the SVD decomposition where diagonal
%     elements of matrix S has to be singular value ranked in decreasing 
%     order of magnitudes. 
%  r:
%     The number of top ra
